Enron_data_Machine_Learning with Python
The goal of this project is to see how Machine learning can help identify Persons of Interest (POI) in the Enron Fraud Scandal by building a person of interest identifier or model based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. Machine learning allows us to find hidden insights to data that are not immediately obvious. Additionally, it helps us build models that can learn and adapt to new data. In this project, we discover what financial data or email data can be used to identify POI. The POI's represent individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity. The dataset contains financial and E-mails data for a number of Enron employees; some of the financial data includes Salaries, bonus, stock options etc, I believe that some of these features can be mined by an algorithm to build a POI Identifier.
